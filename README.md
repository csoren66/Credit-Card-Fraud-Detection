The aim of this machine learning project is to build a classifier that can detect credit card fraudulent transactions. 
We will use a variety of machine learning algorithms that will be able to discern fraudulent from non-fraudulent one. By the end of this machine learning project, you will learn how to implement machine learning algorithms to perform classification.

## Getting started
1.Get the code from the repository
```
(https://github.com/csoren66/Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection.git)
```
2.Download the dataset that will be used to train a transaction classifier. Unzip it and put the content (creditcard.csv) under main folder (Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection)

3.Install required python packages if previously not installed

4.Finally run on Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab and enjoy ðŸ˜‰
