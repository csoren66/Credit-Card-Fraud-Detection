# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

The aim of this machine learning project is to build a classifier that can detect credit card fraudulent transactions. 
We will use a variety of machine learning algorithms that will be able to discern fraudulent from non-fraudulent one. By the end of this machine learning project, you will learn how to implement machine learning algorithms to perform classification.
